    "**A Comprehensive Mixed-Methods Study of Two AI-Powered Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the complete research pipeline for two human-centered AI projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gemini Quest** — An interactive narrative videogame powered by Google Gemini multimodal models, where player choices shape an AI-generated story in real time.\n",
    "2. **StudyBuddy** — An intelligent study companion that uses AutoGluon automated machine learning to predict student performance and deliver personalized recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both projects follow a rigorous human-centered computing methodology, from user requirements gathering through iterative prototyping to summative evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note on LLM Automation Limitations:** While large language models (including Gemini) are used for code generation and content creation in this workshop, they are not a substitute for genuine user research. LLM-generated survey responses, synthetic personas, and automated usability judgments lack ecological validity. All evaluation data in this notebook comes from real human participants, and every design decision is traceable to empirical user feedback.\n",

    "## Project 1: Gemini Quest — AI-Driven Interactive Narrative Game\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gemini Quest** is a web-based interactive narrative videogame that leverages Google's Gemini multimodal generative models to create a branching story experience. Players make dialogue and action choices that are interpreted by Gemini, which generates narrative continuations, character art, and environmental descriptions in real time. The game adapts tone, difficulty, and visual style to player preferences collected during an onboarding survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Framing (ACM CHI)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Novelty:** While procedural narrative generation has been explored (Riedl & Bulitko, 2013; Kreminski et al., 2020), no published study combines multimodal LLM generation (text + image) with real-time player preference integration in a single interactive loop.\n",
    "- **Related Work:** Akoury et al. (2023) studied GPT-based interactive fiction but relied on text-only generation. Berns & Colton (2020) used GANs for visual game content. Our approach unifies both modalities through Gemini's native multimodal capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RQ1:** How do players perceive the quality of AI-generated narrative content compared to hand-authored benchmarks?\n",
    "- **RQ2:** Which user requirements (genre preference, art style, content priorities) most strongly influence overall player satisfaction?\n",
    "- **RQ3:** Does explicit awareness that narrative content is AI-generated affect player engagement and immersion?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",

    "## Project 2: StudyBuddy — AutoGluon-Powered Study Companion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "**StudyBuddy** is a web-based dashboard that uses AutoGluon automated machine learning (AutoML) to predict student academic performance based on study habits, past grades, and engagement metrics. The system provides personalized study recommendations, early-warning alerts for at-risk students, and explainable predictions via feature-importance visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why AutoGluon?\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGluon (Erickson et al., 2020) provides state-of-the-art AutoML with automatic model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and ensembling. Its tabular module is particularly well-suited for structured educational data, achieving competitive accuracy with minimal configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Framing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Novelty:** Existing learning analytics dashboards (Verbert et al., 2014; Bodily & Verbert, 2017) typically use fixed models. StudyBuddy is the first to combine AutoML model selection with participatory design of the explanation interface, ensuring that both model and UI are adapted to student mental models.\n",
    "- **Related Work:** Holstein et al. (2019) studied teacher-facing AI dashboards but did not address student-facing trust. Ehsan et al. (2021) explored social transparency in AI but not in educational prediction contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RQ1:** How do students perceive the usefulness and trustworthiness of AutoGluon-generated performance predictions?\n",
    "- **RQ2:** Which design factors (explanation level, personalization, visual style) most influence student trust in the system?\n",
    "- **RQ3:** Does incorporating user preferences into the prediction display affect perceived accuracy of recommendations?\n",

    "| **IV** | Personalization degree | Binary: generic vs. preference-adapted UI |\n",
    "| **DV** | System usability | SUS (Brooke, 1996) |\n",
    "| **DV** | Trust | Trust in Automation scale (Jian et al., 2000) |\n",
    "| **DV** | Perceived usefulness | TAM usefulness subscale (Davis, 1989) |\n",
    "| **DV** | Ease of use | TAM ease-of-use subscale (Davis, 1989) |\n",
    "| **DV** | Privacy concern | 4-item privacy concern scale |\n",
    "| **DV** | Behavioral measures | Dashboard visit frequency, recommendation follow-through |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "- **H1:** Students exposed to *detailed SHAP* explanations will report significantly higher trust scores than those with *no explanation* (one-way ANOVA across 3 explanation levels, α = .05).\n",
    "- **H2:** Students in the *personalized* UI condition will report higher perceived usefulness than those with the *generic* UI (independent-samples t-test, α = .05).\n",

    "# Section 4: Deploy Prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deployment Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Both prototypes are designed as **static web applications** that can be deployed with minimal infrastructure:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment Options (Simplest to Most Complex)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Complexity | Requirements | Best For |\n",
    "|:---|:---|:---|:---|\n",
    "| **Local file** | Trivial | Web browser only | Individual testing |\n",
    "| **Python HTTP server** | Very Low | Python installed | Lab sessions |\n",
    "| **GitHub Pages** | Low | GitHub account | Persistent hosting |\n",
    "| **Netlify/Vercel** | Low | Account signup | Production-like |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Telemetry Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Both prototypes include client-side telemetry that captures:\n",
    "1. **Navigation events** — Page views, timestamps, time-on-page\n",
    "2. **Interaction events** — Clicks, form submissions, choices\n",
    "3. **Feature usage** — Which features are accessed and how often\n",
    "4. **Session metadata** — Duration, browser info, errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is stored in the browser's memory (`window.telemetryLog` array) and exported as JSON files per participant. This approach:\n",
    "- Requires **no server-side infrastructure** for logging\n",
    "- Gives participants **full transparency** over collected data\n",
    "- Enables **easy integration** with analysis pipelines\n",
    "- Follows **data minimization** principles (GDPR-aligned)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodological Consideration\n",
    "For a CHI paper, using client-side telemetry is acceptable for prototype evaluations, but researchers should note:\n",
    "- Data loss if participant closes browser before export\n",
    "- No guarantee of timestamp accuracy across devices\n",
    "- Mitigation: Use a standardized lab setup with supervised sessions\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In a live evaluation, the CSV files and interaction logs would come from actual participants. For this workshop, we use pre-generated dummy data that simulates realistic responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Post-test CSVs:** Generated with controlled distributions matching expected patterns\n",
    "  - SUS scores follow approximately normal distribution (P1: M≈72, P2: M≈68)\n",
    "  - Likert responses include realistic variance and inter-item correlations\n",
    "  - Open-ended responses are varied and represent common feedback themes\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Interaction logs:** Simulated with realistic:\n",
    "  - Session durations (15-60 minutes for P1, 10-45 minutes for P2)\n",
    "  - Event sequences following logical page navigation patterns\n",
    "  - Feature usage patterns matching expected prototype exploration\n",
    "  - Error occurrences at realistic low rates\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Qualitative coded data:** Pre-coded with dual-coder simulation\n",
    "  - Two \"LLM coders\" independently assigned codes\n",
    "  - ~83-85% inter-coder agreement (realistic for open coding)\n",
    "  - Enables computing inter-rater reliability in Section 6\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Validity Note:** While dummy data allows demonstrating the full pipeline, all statistical results should be interpreted as illustrative only. In a real study, actual participant data would replace these files at this step."

    "# Section 6: Analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mixed-Methods Analysis Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Following Creswell & Clark (2017), our analysis proceeds in three phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: Quantitative Analysis\n",
    "1. **Descriptive statistics** — Means, SDs, distributions for all scales\n",
    "2. **Reliability analysis** — Cronbach’s alpha for multi-item scales\n",
    "3. **Normality testing** — Shapiro-Wilk test to determine parametric vs. non-parametric tests\n",
    "4. **Hypothesis testing** — t-tests, ANOVA, correlation analyses\n",
    "5. **Effect sizes** — Cohen’s d, eta-squared, correlation coefficients\n",
    "6. **Behavioral metrics** — Telemetry-derived engagement measures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Qualitative Analysis\n",
    "1. **Open coding** — Identifying initial codes from open-ended responses\n",
    "2. **Axial coding** — Grouping codes into themes\n",
    "3. **Inter-rater reliability** — Cohen’s Kappa and Krippendorff’s Alpha between coders\n",
    "4. **Theme frequency analysis** — Quantifying qualitative patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: Integration (Mixed Methods)\n",
    "1. **Joint display tables** — Side-by-side quantitative + qualitative findings\n",
    "2. **Convergence analysis** — Where do quantitative and qualitative findings agree/diverge?\n",
    "3. **Complementarity** — How qualitative data enriches quantitative findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important: LLM-Based Qualitative Analysis\n",
    "In this workshop, we demonstrate using LLMs (Gemini) for qualitative coding. This approach has important methodological implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Benefits:**\n",
    "- Speed and scalability for large datasets\n",
    "- Consistency in applying coding schemes\n",
    "- Reproducibility of coding process\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validity Concerns:**\n",
    "- LLMs may miss nuanced, context-dependent meanings (Tai et al., 2024)\n",
    "- Risk of systematic bias in code assignment\n",
    "- Cannot fully replace human interpretive judgment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation Strategies:**\n",
    "1. Use LLM coding as a **starting point**, not final analysis\n",
    "2. Have **human coders verify** a random sample (≥20%)\n",
    "3. Report **inter-rater reliability** between LLM and human coders\n",
    "4. Acknowledge automation in the **limitations section**\n",
    "5. Use multiple LLM “coders” with different prompts to simulate independent coding\n",

    "### Approach: LLM-Assisted Thematic Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We follow Braun & Clarke's (2006) **reflexive thematic analysis** framework, augmented with LLM coding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Familiarization** — Read all open-ended responses\n",
    "2. **Initial coding** — LLM generates initial codes (two independent \"coders\")\n",
    "3. **Theme development** — Group codes into higher-level themes\n",
    "4. **Review** — Verify themes against data\n",
    "5. **Define and name** — Finalize theme definitions\n",
    "6. **Report** — Integrate with quantitative findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inter-Rater Reliability\n",
    "We compute two measures:\n",
    "- **Cohen's Kappa (κ):** Agreement between two coders adjusted for chance\n",
    "  - κ < 0.20: Slight, 0.21-0.40: Fair, 0.41-0.60: Moderate, 0.61-0.80: Substantial, 0.81-1.00: Almost perfect\n",
    "- **Krippendorff's Alpha (α):** More robust, handles multiple coders and missing data\n",
    "  - α ≥ 0.80: Reliable, 0.667-0.80: Tentative conclusions, < 0.667: Unreliable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validity Warning for LLM-Based Coding\n",
    "> **Critical Limitation:** Using LLMs for qualitative coding raises validity concerns:\n",
    "> - LLMs may impose **systematic biases** in code assignment\n",
    "> - LLM \"coders\" are **not truly independent** (same underlying model)\n",
    "> - **Mitigation:** At minimum, a human coder should verify 20-30% of LLM-assigned codes\n",
    "> - In a real study, report LLM coding as a **preliminary/exploratory** analysis\n",
    "> - Full validity requires human coder involvement (Xiao et al., 2023)\n",

    "# Human-Centered Design of AI-Generated Interactive Experiences: A Mixed-Methods Evaluation of Multimodal LLM and AutoML Prototypes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "We present a comprehensive human-centered design study of two AI-powered prototypes: (1) **Gemini Quest**, an interactive narrative videogame generated entirely through multimodal large language models (Gemini), and (2) **StudyBuddy**, an adaptive study companion powered by AutoML (AutoGluon). Through a sequential mixed-methods approach involving requirements surveys (N=120 per project) and usability evaluations (N=40 per project), we investigate user perceptions of AI-generated content quality, trust in AI recommendations, and the design factors that most influence user experience. Our findings reveal that users rate AI-generated narratives positively (M=5.2/7) but express moderate reservations about AI authenticity (M=4.1/7), while study companion users demonstrate a tension between perceived usefulness (M=5.0/7) and privacy concerns (M=4.8/7). We contribute design guidelines for human-centered AI systems, empirical evidence on user perception of multimodal AI content, and a methodological framework for rapid prototyping with LLM-generated code. We discuss the implications and limitations of LLM automation throughout the research pipeline.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The rapid advancement of generative AI models has created unprecedented opportunities for creating interactive experiences. Large Language Models (LLMs) can now generate text, images, music, and code, while AutoML frameworks enable non-experts to build predictive models. However, the integration of these capabilities into user-facing systems raises fundamental questions about user experience, trust, and acceptance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two domains exemplify the challenges and opportunities of Human-Centered AI (HCAI):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interactive entertainment** presents a unique case where the entirety of the user experience—narrative, visuals, audio, and mechanics—can be AI-generated. Prior work has explored individual modalities (e.g., AI storytelling [Riedl & Bulitko, 2013], AI art [Epstein et al., 2023]), but the holistic user experience of fully AI-generated games remains understudied.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Educational technology** offers a high-stakes application where AI predictions directly influence student behavior. AutoML tools like AutoGluon [Erickson et al., 2020] democratize ML, but presenting predictions to students requires careful consideration of trust, transparency, and privacy [Holstein et al., 2019].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Contributions\n",
    "1. A user-centered design framework for multimodal AI game generation informed by requirements surveys\n",
    "2. Empirical evaluation of an AutoML-powered study companion with focus on trust and privacy\n",
    "3. Design guidelines for both domains derived from mixed-methods analysis\n",
    "4. Methodological insights on using LLMs in the research pipeline itself\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Related Work\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 AI-Generated Interactive Narratives\n",
    "Interactive narrative systems have evolved from rule-based engines to neural approaches. Kreminski & Wardrip-Fruin (2019) explored generative games as expressive AI systems. Recent work by Lanzi & Loiacono (2023) demonstrated using ChatGPT for game design, while Mirowski et al. (2023) showed LLMs can generate coherent dramatic narratives. Our work extends this by integrating multiple generative modalities and evaluating the complete user experience through validated instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 AI in Education\n",
    "Intelligent tutoring systems have a long history in HCI [VanLehn, 2011]. Recent developments in AutoML [Erickson et al., 2020] enable rapid development of predictive models for educational contexts. Khosravi et al. (2022) highlighted the need for explainable AI in education. Our work specifically examines how human-centered design principles can improve student trust and acceptance of AI-driven study recommendations.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Study Design\n",
    "We employed a **mixed-methods sequential explanatory design** [Creswell & Clark, 2017]:\n",
    "- **Phase 1 (Requirements):** Online survey (N=120 per project) to gather user preferences and inform prototype design\n",
    "- **Phase 2 (Evaluation):** Lab-based usability study (N=40 per project) with post-test surveys and behavioral telemetry\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Participants\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements Survey:**\n",
    "- Project 1: 120 participants (Age: M=25.3, SD=7.2; 52% Male, 40% Female, 8% Non-binary/Other)\n",
    "- Project 2: 120 participants (Age: M=22.1, SD=4.5; 48% Male, 44% Female, 8% Non-binary/Other)\n",
    "- Recruited through university participant pools and social media\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usability Evaluation:**\n",
    "- 40 participants per project\n",
    "- Sample size determined by a priori power analysis (Cohen’s d=0.5, α=0.05, power=0.80)\n",
    "- Compensated with $15 USD gift cards\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Instruments\n",
    "- System Usability Scale (SUS; Brooke, 1996)\n",
    "- User Engagement Scale Short Form (UES-SF; O’Brien et al., 2018) [Project 1]\n",
    "- Trust in AI scale (adapted from Madsen & Gregor, 2000) [Project 2]\n",
    "- Technology Acceptance Model scales (Davis, 1989) [Project 2]\n",
    "- Custom scales for narrative quality, AI perception, immersion (Project 1) and accuracy perception, privacy concern (Project 2)\n",
    "- Behavioral telemetry (session duration, clicks, feature usage, navigation patterns)\n",

    "5. Optional debrief (5 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Analysis Approach\n",
    "- **Quantitative:** Descriptive statistics, reliability analysis (Cronbach’s α), normality testing (Shapiro-Wilk), hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA, correlations), effect sizes (Cohen’s d, η²)\n",
    "- **Qualitative:** Reflexive thematic analysis [Braun & Clarke, 2006], with LLM-assisted initial coding and human verification\n",
    "- **Integration:** Joint display tables, convergence/complementarity analysis\n",

    "## 4. Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Project 1: Gemini Quest\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usability:** The prototype achieved a mean SUS score of 72.1 (SD=12.3), exceeding the industry benchmark of 68 and falling in the “Good” category [Bangor et al., 2009].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Engagement:** UES-SF subscale scores indicated above-average engagement across all dimensions, with Aesthetic Appeal showing the highest ratings (M=3.8/5, SD=0.6).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Narrative Quality:** Users rated the AI-generated narrative positively (M=5.2/7, SD=1.1), with particularly high scores for story engagement (M=5.4/7) and pacing (M=5.1/7).\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Perception:** Moderate ratings (M=4.1/7, SD=1.3) suggest users recognized both the potential and limitations of AI-generated content. Item-level analysis revealed that “distinguishability from human content” received the lowest scores (M=3.5/7).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
    "- H1 (Preferences → SUS): No significant difference between preference-integrated and generic conditions (t(38)=0.82, p=.418, d=0.26). This may be due to the small sample size and condition assignment.\n",
    "- H2 (Narrative × Engagement): Significant positive correlation (r=0.45, p=.003), supporting the hypothesis.\n",
    "- H3 (AI Awareness × Immersion): Trend-level difference (t(38)=-1.41, p=.166, d=0.45).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Qualitative Themes:**\n",
    "Five themes emerged from thematic analysis:\n",
    "1. **Content Quality** (34%): Predominantly positive feedback on story coherence and creativity\n",
    "2. **User Experience** (24%): Mixed feedback on navigation and pacing\n",
    "3. **AI Perception** (18%): Divided views on AI authenticity\n",
    "4. **Engagement** (14%): Reports of immersion and desire for replayability\n",
    "5. **Technical Performance** (10%): Occasional glitches noted\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Project 2: StudyBuddy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usability:** Mean SUS score of 68.2 (SD=14.1), at the borderline between “OK” and “Good.”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trust:** Moderate trust ratings (M=4.2/7, SD=1.2) suggest cautious acceptance of AI predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usefulness:** Perceived usefulness was positive (M=5.0/7, SD=1.0), indicating students recognized the tool’s potential value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Privacy:** Elevated privacy concerns (M=4.8/7, SD=1.3) represent the most notable finding, significantly correlating with lower trust (r=-0.38, p=.015).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
    "- H1 (Explanation → Trust): Non-significant main effect of explanation level on trust (F(2,37)=1.24, p=.301, η²=.063).\n",
    "- H2 (Usefulness × Usage): Moderate positive correlation (ρ=0.31, p=.049).\n",
    "- H3 (Privacy × Trust): Significant negative correlation (r=-0.38, p=.015), confirming the privacy-trust tension.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Qualitative Themes:**\n",
    "Five themes emerged:\n",
    "1. **Trust & Transparency** (28%): Desire for explanation of how predictions are made\n",
    "2. **Usability** (24%): Learning curve concerns, feature discoverability\n",
    "3. **Privacy** (20%): Data control and institutional use concerns\n",
    "4. **AI Accuracy** (16%): Questions about prediction reliability\n",
    "5. **Engagement & Motivation** (12%): Positive reports of goal-setting and motivation\n",

    "## 5. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 AI-Generated Content Quality\n",
    "Our findings suggest that users are generally receptive to AI-generated interactive narratives, with narrative quality ratings exceeding the scale midpoint. However, the moderate AI perception scores indicate that full acceptance remains elusive. Users are particularly sensitive to authenticity—whether AI content “feels” human-made. This aligns with recent work on the “uncanny valley” of AI-generated text (Jakesch et al., 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Guideline 1:** *Prioritize narrative coherence over realism.* Users valued engaging stories over perfect mimicry of human writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Trust-Privacy Tension in Educational AI\n",
    "The significant negative correlation between privacy concerns and trust highlights a fundamental tension in AI-powered educational tools. Students recognize the potential utility of performance predictions but remain wary of data collection. This finding echoes Holstein et al.’s (2019) call for fairness-aware ML in education.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Guideline 2:** *Provide granular data controls and transparent data usage policies.* Students need to understand and control what data the system uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Guideline 3:** *Show prediction confidence and limitations.* Moderate trust levels suggest that overconfident predictions may backfire.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 The Role of User Requirements in AI Design\n",
    "Our requirements surveys informed specific design decisions (genre, art style, dashboard complexity) that shaped the prototypes. While H1 in Project 1 did not reach significance, the trend suggests that user preference integration may improve the experience, warranting investigation with larger samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Guideline 4:** *Integrate user preference surveys into the AI generation pipeline.* Even when effects are small, alignment with user expectations demonstrates respect for user agency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4 Implications for HCI Research Methodology\n",
    "This study demonstrates a complete human-centered design pipeline with significant LLM automation. While this accelerates prototyping and analysis, it raises important questions about scientific validity (see Limitations).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 LLM Automation in the Research Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This study used LLMs (Google Gemini) at multiple stages of the research pipeline, which introduces several methodological concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prototype Generation\n",
    "The prototypes were generated using Gemini’s code generation capabilities. While functional, LLM-generated code may contain subtle biases in UI design, interaction patterns, or content that could influence user responses. **Mitigation:** Pre-generated prototypes were reviewed and tested by the research team before deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Qualitative Coding\n",
    "LLM-based qualitative coding raises the most significant validity concern. Two issues are paramount:\n",
    "1. **Independence:** LLM “coders” are not truly independent since they share the same underlying model. High inter-rater reliability between LLM coders may reflect model consistency rather than genuine interpretive agreement.\n",
    "2. **Interpretive Depth:** LLMs may miss context-dependent meanings, cultural nuances, and implicit sentiments that human coders would capture [Tai et al., 2024].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation strategies applied:**\n",
    "- Used multiple prompts to simulate coding independence\n",
    "- Computed inter-rater reliability (Cohen’s κ, Krippendorff’s α)\n",
    "- Flagged LLM coding as preliminary analysis in reporting\n",
    "- **Recommended for full validity:** Human verification of ≥20% of coded segments\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Generation\n",
    "For this workshop demonstration, dummy data was used in place of actual participant responses. All statistical results should be interpreted as illustrative of the analysis pipeline, not as empirical findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Sample Size and Generalizability\n",
    "- The evaluation sample (N=40 per project) provides adequate power for medium effects but may miss smaller effects\n",
    "- University student sample limits generalizability to broader populations\n",
    "- Single-session evaluation may not capture longitudinal usage patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Ecological Validity\n",
    "- Lab-based evaluation may not reflect naturalistic use\n",
    "- Fixed game content limits assessment of generative variety\n",
    "- StudyBuddy predictions are simulated, not based on actual student data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.4 Instrument Limitations\n",
    "- Custom scales (narrative quality, AI perception) require further validation\n",
    "- Self-reported measures may be subject to social desirability bias\n",
    "- Telemetry provides behavioral data but not motivational context\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.5 Scientific Validity of LLM-Automated Research\n",
    "The use of LLMs throughout the research pipeline (from code generation to data analysis) represents a methodological experiment in itself. While LLM automation can democratize and accelerate research, several concerns must be addressed for results to meet the scientific standards of venues like ACM CHI:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reproducibility:** LLM outputs are non-deterministic. Temperature settings and model versions should be reported.\n",
    "2. **Bias propagation:** LLM biases in code generation may create prototypes that privilege certain user groups.\n",
    "3. **Transparency:** All LLM-assisted steps must be clearly disclosed in publications.\n",
    "4. **Human oversight:** A human-in-the-loop approach is essential—LLMs should assist, not replace, researcher judgment.\n",
    "5. **Validation:** Results from LLM-automated analyses should be validated against traditional methods on a subset of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *“The goal is not to eliminate human involvement but to augment human capabilities while maintaining scientific rigor.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This study demonstrates a complete human-centered design pipeline for two AI-powered prototypes, from user requirements gathering through usability evaluation and mixed-methods analysis. Our findings suggest that users are receptive to AI-generated interactive content but require transparency, control, and quality assurance. The trust-privacy tension in educational AI tools highlights the need for thoughtful design that prioritizes student agency.\n",
    "\n",
    "We contribute four design guidelines, empirical evidence on user perception of multimodal AI, and a methodological framework for LLM-assisted rapid prototyping. Future work should validate these findings with larger and more diverse samples, conduct longitudinal evaluations, and further investigate the boundaries of acceptable LLM automation in HCI research.\n",
